This was actually my first time trying to learn terminal commands..even though i previously have used linux, i never thought of learning terminal commands. thanks to this task now i know a bunch of terminal commands. Though i had a hard time rewriting the whole code for like 5 times just because i made a mistake in the middle (This was because i had assumed that i had to send the screenshot of my terminal with all the codes) it was fun!!
