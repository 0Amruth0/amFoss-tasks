a.Why must we choose you? -> I am basically a fastlearner and a good listener. As I saw in the club introductory session, there are so many experienced coders in the club. I would like to take this as an oppotrunity to get the most knowledge i can from the club .I am always motivated to do things when it comes to computerscience. I think with my learning pace, motivation and desire to learn and teach things i would be a better addition to the club.

b.What is your plan for the next 6 months? -> SO in the next 6 months i am planning to learn python, c, c++,java. i feel its very important to learn some languages to continue my coding journey.Hopefully the club will help me with it..

c.How would you contribute back to the club? -> I feel i still am not so experienced to do some super great contibutions to the club. But i can ensure that i can contribute to the fullest with in my domain and help in the further proceeding of the club.
 
d.Do you have any feedback for the selection process? -> I feel many challenges are not possible to be solved without knowing languages like python,c,c++,java,javascript . I think we first need to have challenges which will familiarize us with these languages.
