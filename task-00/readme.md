This task was easy for me as I had installed different operating systems like kali linux,pop os,ubuntu etc. But even so I just went through a youtube video and I successfully installed ubuntu in my laptop.I was first afraid to make a parition in ssd as I had read somewhere that its bad to parition a ssd. But I just went for it and thankfully everything is fine now...
